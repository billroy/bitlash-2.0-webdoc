===== Bitlash Online =====
Welcome to Bitlash Online.

Bitlash is an open source interpreted language shell.  This website documents Bitlash for the popular and useful [[http://arduino.cc|Arduino]].

The Bitlash interpreter runs entirely on the Arduino and interprets commands that you type in a terminal window or send programmatically to the serial port:
<code>
bitlash here! v1.0 (c) 2010 Bill Roy -type HELP- 1383 bytes free
> print "Hello, world!", millis()
Hello, world! 11939
> 
</code>

==== What is Bitlash? ====

Bitlash is an embedded interpreter that runs in about 14k of memory on an Atmel AVR processor.  It works nicely with Arduino to make a development and prototyping tool for those situations where you need to bang some bits on the Arduino but writing a sketch in C is premature.  It's very convenient for bringing up and debugging new hardware.

The Bitlash command language is very similar to Arduino C and includes a large repertiore of the familiar Arduino C functions so you can hack your hardware from the serial command line or even over the internet via telnet.

You can store commands as macros in EEPROM and autostart them at bootup, making the automation and maintenance of small applications very easy.  Here is the classic Blink13 program as a complete Bitlash application in two macros, **toggle13** to toggle the led and **startup** to initialize and run it:
<code>
> toggle13:="d13=!d13"
> startup:="pinmode(13,1);run toggle13,1000"
> boot
(d13 flashes)
</code>

==== Release Announcements ====

=== Bitlash 1.0 Available Now ===

After over a year in development Bitlash 1.0 is available for {{bitlash-1-release.zip|download}}.

The is one bug fix since the RC2 version, renaming the folders and files in the /examples tree to remove the '-' which became deprecated in Arduino 0017.

Bitlash 1.0 is tested on [[http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software|Arduino 0017]] and [[http://code.google.com/p/arduino/downloads/list|Arduino 0018 RC1]].  The [[install]] instructions are updated for 0017.
